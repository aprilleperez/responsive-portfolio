# responsive-portfolio

## Description
This assignment was to make the original Basic Portfolio into a responsive, mobile-friendly layout. As developers, it is smart to consider mobile-first design/development in the current industry. Whether or not an application is defaulted for mobile or desktop, responsive design should be incorporated for cross-browser function and varying sizes of viewports, regardless of device.

## Languages Used
HTML, CSS, GoogleFonts

## Composition
About/Index page, Portfolio Page, Contact Page

## Takeaways
Re-working my basic portfolio to be responsive was exciting, as well as review for how to use media queries. I started thinking about re-working my code altogether to make it more sensible and cleaner for responsive queries. Overall, I felt that my site benefitted from being upgraded to responsive code and I will need to keep practicing with mastering the incorporation of media queries.

## Feedback
Some difficulties I had included:
Navbar: I still haven't been able to figure out why I can't change the color of the a:visited link from purple to white

Gallery Container: Since I got the CSS from another source, I wasn't entirely sure how to successfully center each individual image within its container, and the gallery doesn't scroll with the bounding container. These are some issues that I will have to continue to work with the more I practice HTML/CSS fluency.
